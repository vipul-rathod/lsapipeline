configuration:
    menu_name:
        type: str
        default_value: "Load Objects..."
        description: Name to appear on the Shotgun menu.

    title_name:
        type: str
        default_value: "Add items to your Scene"
        description: Name to appear on the title of the UI Dialog.

    button_name:
        type: str
        default_value: "Load Selected Item"
        description: Name to appear on the load button.

    dependency_mode:
        type: bool
        default_value: false
        description: If enabled, the loader app will display versions in the middle pane
                     and dependent files in the right most pane.

    single_select:
        type: bool
        default_value: true
        description: If set to true, the loader dialog will close automatically once an
                     item has been loaded.

    sg_entity_types:
        type: dict
        description: "Types of Shotgun entities to present in the left-most column in the browser.
                      Typically these are Shots and Assets but could also be Mocap Takes, Elements
                      or custom entities. The value should be organized as a dictionary, where the 
                      key is the Entity Type and the value is a list of Shotgun filters that will be
                      used when retrieving the list of items. If no filter is specified, all items
                      will be loaded. For example, if you want to display only shots  
                      that are in progress, set the value to:
                      
                          {'Shot': [['sg_status_list', 'is', 'ip']]}
                      
                      Properties from the context can also be used in the shotgun filters. Valid 
                      properties are:
                      
                          {context.entity}
                          {context.project}
                          {context.step}
                          {context.task}
                          {context.user}
                          
                      For example, to show all shots belonging to the project in the current context, 
                      set the value to: 
                      
                          {'Shot' : [[project, is, '{context.project}']]}"
                      
        default_value: {"Shot": [] }

    tank_types:
        type: list
        description: "List of Published file types to include in the publish listings. Leaving the list
                      empty will include all types."
        allows_empty: True
        values:
            type: tank_type
            
    publish_filters:
        type: list
        description: "List of additional shotgun filters to apply to the publish listings.  These
                      are in addition to filtering on current entity and any specified tank_types.
                      
                      Context properties can also be used in publish filters.  For example, to show
                      all publishes for the user in the current context, set the value to:
                      
                          [['created_by', 'is', '{context.user}']"
        values:
            type: shotgun_filter
            
        allows_empty: True
        default_value: []
                    
    hook_add_file_to_scene:
        type: hook
        description: Called when a file is loaded. The file_path parameter will contain a path 
                     to the file on disk to load and the shotgun_data parameter is a dictionary
                     of associated shotgun data.
        parameters: [engine_name, file_path, shotgun_data]
        default_value: multi_add_file_to_scene
